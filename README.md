Q: Given a list of words like https://github.com/NodePrime/quiz/blob/master/word.list find the longest compound-word in the list, which is also a concatenation of other sub-words that exist in the list. The program should allow the user to input different data. The finished solution shouldn't take more than one hour. Any programming language can be used, but Go is preferred.

A: Assuming go is installed:
## compile
- Fork repo into your system
- ``` cd "/forked repository path/"```
- ``` go build main.go ```

## run
- Make sure word.list and main.exe are on the same directory
- (Assuming we are on Windows)
- ```make.exe```
- or ```make.exe word2.list```
- or ```make.exe "/path to your file/file.list"```


Fork this repo, add your solution and documentation on how to compile and run your solution. Please send us a link to your repo.

Obviously, we are looking for a fresh solution, not based on others' code.
